# Steps for launching multiplayer ðŸŒ©
1. The binding `IP` of the server can be configured in `./Common/Config/Settings.cs` file with `ServerIPAddress` variable (will need to rebuild both server and client).
2. It's highly recommended to launch the server from the `./Server/bin/{build_version}/{.net_version}/Server.exe` file instead of Visual Studio.
3. It's also recommended to launch both Snakey clients from `./Snakey/bin/{build_version}/{.net_version}/Snakey.exe` files.


After server and clients are launched, simply press `Connect to server` button in both clients (if server is not launched it will simply crash both clients).

Good gaming :^)
